# Welcome to the Hurt and Heal Games

This game is about finding the ultimate survivor from a list of...well however
many! Every turn you will be able to **HURT** one character and **HEAL** another,
appropriately lowering their hp by one or raising it by one. Whenever a character's
hp hits 0, they are removed from the list. Whenever a character's hp hits a
safety mark of 30, they are moved to a "haven" that prevents them from being
affected until there is only one person left in the main area...in which case all characters
in the haven are moved back into the fray back at the base hp. This continues
until there is only one character left, with that character being named
the winner!

In order to participate, all you have to do is reply to this op in the following
manor:

```
++{character you want to heal's id}
--{character you want to hurt's id}
```

You can comment once every 4 hours! Use it wisely! You can check if you are on
