text = '# Welcome to the Hurt and Heal Games \
\n\n\
This game is about finding the ultimate survivor from a list of...well however \
many! Every turn you will be able to **HURT** one character and **HEAL** another, \
appropriately lowering their hp by one or raising it by one. Whenever a character\'s \
hp hits 0, they are removed from the list. Whenever a character\'s hp hits a \
safety mark of 30, they are moved to a "haven" that prevents them from being \
affected until there is only one person left in the main area...in which case all characters \
in the haven are moved back into the fray back at the base hp. This continues \
until there is only one character left, with that character being named \
the winner! \
\n\n\
In order to participate, all you have to do is reply to this op in the following \
manor: \
\n\n \
``` \
++{character you want to heal\'s id} \
--{character you want to hurt\'s id} \
``` \
\n\n\
You can comment once every 4 hours! Use it wisely! You can check if you are on \
cooldown below. \
\n\n\
Without further to do, here are your contestants! \
